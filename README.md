# Ray Tracer

<img src="Images/Rendering%20Competition%20Still.png" width="750">

This repository contains a ray tracer implemented from scratch using only C++ and some basic functionalities offered
by the **GLM (OpenGL Mathematics)** library.

It started as a sequence of assignments during the 2024th edition of *Computer Graphics*, a course of the Bachelor of
Informatics course at [USI](https://www.usi.ch/en/education/bachelor/informatics).

During the course I implemented multiple features, which ultimately allowed me to win the 4th edition of the USI's 
Rendering Competition.

## Basic Features

As per today, 30th January 2025, the Ray Tracer implementation includes the following basic features:

+ *Primitives Shapes*: sphere, cones, planes, cylinders and triangles are all included and functioning.

+ *Reflection and Refraction*: both of this core ray tracing features have been implemented and used extensively.

+ *Meshes*: the software is able to parse complex OBJ files and associated MTL files, creating corresponding meshes 
and materials.

+ *Stochastic Ray Tracing*: by adopting a stochastic approach to ray tracing, I was able to render effects such as depth
+ of field, semigloss materials such opaque mirrors and adaptive super-sampling antialiasing.

## Advanced Features

As per today, 30th January 2025, the ray tracer implementation includes the following more advanced features:

+ *BVH*: using the Surface Area Heuristic, I implemented a Bounding Volume Hierarchy heavily inspired by the 
implementation showcased in the 4th chapter of 
[Physically Based Rendering](https://pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Primitives_and_Intersection_Acceleration), 3th edition.

+ *Perlin Noise*: I implemented a complete Perlin Noise algorithm, using both the original paper [An image synthesizer]
(https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/280811.280986) and the additional improvements explained in the paper
[Improving noise](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/566654.566636). I used this algorithm to create a multitude of 
different effects, such as normal maps, textures, and displacement maps.

+ *Cook-Torrance Model*: replacing the original Blinn-Phong model, I implemented this model to obtain a more realistic
variety of materials and effects, including anisotropy.

+ *Texturing Pipeline*: using sample texture taken from [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/), I implemented a texturing
pipeline able to apply albedo textures, ambient occlusion + roughness + metallic textures (AORM texture), displacement 
maps, and normal maps.

+ *Photons Mapping*: using [A Practical Guide to Global Illumination using Photon Maps]
(https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs348b-01/course8.pdf) I implemented an algorithm able to render caustics 
generated by spheres of glass.

+ *Participating Media*: I implemented a basic volume rendering technique able to render volume absorbing lights. This
algorithm can use both basic primitives such as planes and complex mesh-based shapes.
