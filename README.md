<img src="Images/Rendering%20Competition%20Still.png" width="750">

This repository contains a ray tracer implemented from scratch using only C++ and some basic functionalities offered
by the **GLM (OpenGL Mathematics)** library.

It started as a sequence of assignments during the 2024th edition of *Computer Graphics*, a course of the Bachelor of
Informatics course at [USI](https://www.usi.ch/en/education/bachelor/informatics).

During the course I implemented multiple features, which ultimately allowed me to win the 4th edition of the USI's 
Rendering Competition
